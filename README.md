# Abstract
The Finite Residual Rule of Sum (FRSR) unifies quantum entanglement, vacuum energy, and spacetime curvature into a single coherent framework. Developed from the principle that finite energy residuals within entangled bands give rise to observable curvature, FRSR provides a cosmological interpretation where discrete negative-energy bands entangled with the continuous positive-energy sector generate the observed cosmological constant $`\Lambda`$. This approach bridges microscopic entanglement structure and macroscopic curvature, offering a falsifiable path to explain $`\Lambda`$ without ultraviolet divergences or ad-hoc fine-tuning.

## 1. Introduction: Finite Residual Rule of Sum
*(Originally developed under the working title “God Plays Dice / Λ‑Origin.”)*

We propose that the observed cosmological constant **$`\Lambda`$** is the tiny, finite residual of a symmetric vacuum composed of a *finite number of negative-energy bands* entangled with their positive-energy counterparts.  

Each band contributes an energy density weighted by its entanglement strength, and the sum reproduces $`\Lambda`$ without UV divergences or ad-hoc fine-tuning.  

This yields a compact **finite-residual sum rule** that is testable in principle and compatible with Lorentz invariance and $`w \simeq -1`$.

The cosmological constant is the leftover curvature of broken time symmetry.

## 2. Framework: Existence Within Spacetime

Quantum entanglement — expressed by the weights $`\mathcal{E}_{i}`$ — encodes **non‑spatial structure**, a network of pure correlations that exist beyond classical spacetime.  
The global coupling constant $`\kappa`$ governs how this hidden informational structure *projects into* the geometric fabric of spacetime.  

When discrete negative‑energy (−E) bands exchange information with the continuous positive‑energy (+E) field, their interaction translates informational geometry into **vacuum energy density**, which in turn produces measurable **spacetime curvature** $`\Lambda`$.  

In essence, entanglement defines the invisible architecture of existence, while curvature is its visible trace in the universe.

| Level | Domain | Description | Dimensional Character |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Entanglement ($`\mathcal{E}_{i}`$) | Pure correlation, non-spatial | dimensionless |
| 2 | Coupling ($`\kappa`$) | Translation from correlation → geometry | dimensionless (meta-geometric) |
| 3 | Energy density ($`\rho_{-,i}`$) | Manifested energy in spacetime | [M L⁻³] |
| 4 | Curvature ($`\Lambda`$) | Observable geometry of existence | [L⁻²] |

## 3. Master Equation (Cosmological Core)

Projecting the Finite Residual Rule of Sum (FRSR) into the spacetime domain yields a simple energy–curvature correspondence.  
Each discrete negative-energy band contributes a weighted share to the total curvature, producing the observed cosmological constant:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{bare}} + \frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}} \kappa \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\mathrm{fin}}} \mathcal{E}_{i} \rho_{-,i}.
$$

**Here:**
- $`G`$ — Newton’s constant  
- $`c`$ — speed of light  
- $`\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}`$ — observed cosmological constant  
- $`\lambda_{\mathrm{bare}}`$ — bare curvature term  
- $`\kappa`$ — global dimensionless coupling  
- $`N_{\mathrm{fin}}`$ — number of discrete negative-energy (−E) bands  
- $`\rho_{-,i}`$ — energy density of band *i*  
- $`\mathcal{E}_{i}`$ — entanglement weight coupling each −E band to the continuous +E field

The term $`\lambda_{\mathrm{bare}}`$ represents the geometric curvature of empty spacetime in the absence of any entangled contributions. It can be interpreted as the zero-point offset in the curvature–energy relationship and remains a constant reference background, not fitted by FRSR parameters.

This compact form represents the **Einstein–FRSR bridge**, where finite residuals in the −E domain translate directly into measurable curvature in the +E universe.

### 3.1 Derivation Outline (Summary)

**Einstein’s Energy–Curvature Identity.** General Relativity connects curvature to vacuum energy density as

$$
\rho_\Lambda = \frac{\Lambda c^2}{8\pi G}.
$$

**FRSR Finite-Band Structure.** The finite set of discrete −E bands, each with entanglement weight $`\mathcal{E}_{i}`$ and energy density $`\rho_{-,i}`$, defines a structured residual energy field. The coupling $`\kappa`$ transfers this entangled energy into curvature.

**Combination into the FRSR Equation.** Substituting the FRSR structure into Einstein’s identity gives the full expression

$$
   \Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{bare}} + \frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}} \kappa \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\mathrm{fin}}} \mathcal{E}_{i} \rho_{-,i}.
$$

The observed curvature is thus the sum of a geometric baseline ($`\lambda_{\mathrm{bare}}`$) and a finite-residual correction arising from quantum entanglement.

**Note.** FRSR does *not* quantize spacetime itself. Instead, it quantizes the *vacuum energy source* that drives curvature, leaving the Einstein geometry continuous and classical.

**Narrow-band estimate (origin).** Starting from the zero‑point energy density integral,

$$
\rho_{\text{vac}} = \frac{\hbar c}{2} \int_0^{k_{\max}} \frac{4\pi k^2 \mathrm{d}k}{(2\pi)^3}
= \frac{\hbar c}{4\pi^2} \int_0^{k_{\max}} k^3 \mathrm{d}k,
$$

the FRSR replacement of the continuous spectrum by finite −E bands treats each band as a narrow slice of width $`\Delta k_i`$ centered at $`k_i`$, yielding

$$
\rho_{-,i} \approx \frac{\hbar c}{4\pi^2} k_i^3 \Delta k_i.
$$

**Projection from Momentum to Spacetime.**  
Each finite −E band exists in Fourier (momentum) space and contributes a bounded spectral energy density. The parameter $`\Delta k_i`$ defines the finite momentum width of the band — effectively the coherence interval of that mode. When projected into spacetime, these spectral densities appear as real‑space vacuum energy contributions $`\rho_{-,i}`$ that source curvature via the coupling term $`\kappa \mathcal{E}_{i}`$. Thus, the transition from spectral structure to curvature arises through entanglement‑mediated energy transfer between the −E (spectral) and +E (geometric) domains. The small asymmetry between these sectors—imperfect cancellation across finite bandwidths $`\Delta k_i`$—produces the finite residual $`\Lambda_{\mathrm{FRSR}}`$.

## 4. Motivation

The central empirical fact is that the Universe exhibits a tiny but non‑zero cosmological constant, $`\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}`$, with an equation of state $`w \simeq -1`$ that appears stable over cosmic time. Standard quantum‑field estimates of vacuum energy overshoot by $`\sim 10^{122}`$ in Planck units and rely on delicate cancellations. FRSR addresses this tension by proposing that the vacuum is not featureless: a **finite set of negative‑energy (−E) bands** remains entangled with the **continuous positive‑energy (+E) sector**. A small structural asymmetry between these sectors leaves a **finite residual** that manifests as $`\Lambda`$.

**Objectives of FRSR**
- Provide a GR‑compatible map from entanglement weights $`\{ \mathcal{E}_{i} \}`$ and band densities $`\{ \rho_{-,i} \}`$ **directly to curvature** via a single finite‑sum rule.
- Remove UV divergence by assuming $`N_{\mathrm{fin}} < \infty`$ and isotropy, while **preserving $`w = -1`$** (Lorentz‑invariant vacuum stress).
- Make the framework **falsifiable** through measurable constraints on the entanglement‑weighted band sum $`\sum_i \mathcal{E}_{i} \rho_{-,i}`$, fixed by the observed $`\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}`$, and through the possibility of **extremely small, scale‑dependent residuals** $`\delta\Lambda`$ consistent with cosmological observations.
- Remain **agnostic about microdynamics**: a possible stochastic substrate interpretation may be developed in future work, but it is **not required** for the cosmological results presented here.

Although FRSR can be interpreted statistically—each finite entangled band acting as a weighted transition between information and curvature—the present formulation remains geometric, expressed through the four fundamental translations: information → coupling → energy → curvature.

> In the FRSR framework, the observable universe (the +E sea) represents the visible projection of a deeper entangled duality.  
> The −E sea, unobservable and non-temporal, acts as the source of finite informational impulses — the domain where “God plays dice.”  
> Each such impulse induces a curvature response in the +E continuum, producing the small but measurable residual identified as $`\Lambda`$.  
> Forward time emerges because the +E domain continuously reacts to earlier −E correlations; these stored correlations form our causal memory.  
> The −E domain itself does not evolve in time — it establishes the very conditions that make temporal evolution possible.

GR permits boundary conditions or background fields that define geometry before time evolution; in this sense the −E sector functions as a fixed entanglement substrate relative to the evolving +E domain.

At the macroscopic scale, FRSR is fully deterministic, describing how entanglement-mediated curvature arises from finite residual structures in energy space. However, at microscopic scales, the same finite-band architecture could admit a stochastic interpretation: each discrete −E band may represent an ensemble-averaged fluctuation within the entanglement field. This perspective does not alter the deterministic geometry but provides an open pathway toward modeling microscopic variability and linking FRSR to measurable quantum phenomena.

## 5. Physical Interpretation

FRSR interprets the vacuum as a continuous +E field entangled with a finite set of discrete −E bands; the resulting finite residual projects into spacetime as vacuum energy (curvature).

In this framework, the −E sector resides naturally in the spectral (momentum) domain and manifests geometrically only through its entanglement‑weighted energy densities projected into spacetime curvature.

Key physical insights include:
- Residuals represent intrinsic finite spectral features of the vacuum with measurable strength distributions.
- The framework allows finite-memory effects via the discrete −E band structure $`\{ k_i, \Delta k_i, \mathcal{E}_{i} \}`$.
- Entanglement-weighted couplings ($`\kappa \mathcal{E}_{i}`$) connect finite-band structure to curvature, enabling parameter inference from cosmological data.

## 6. Falsifiability

The FRSR framework is falsifiable through its explicit predictions on the distribution and statistics of finite residuals:

- Constraints on the entanglement-weighted band sum $`\sum_i \mathcal{E}_{i} \rho_{-,i}`$ can validate or refute the assumed finite-band structure.
- Deviations between observed and predicted values of $`\Lambda`$ or its local-scale fluctuations $`\delta\Lambda`$ provide a direct test of the FRSR framework.
- Spatiotemporal analyses of cosmological data (e.g., CMB anisotropies, BAO, Type-Ia supernovae, weak lensing) can test for tiny, scale-dependent deviations $`\delta\Lambda`$ predicted by finite-band structure.

## 7. Relation to Existing Theories

FRSR aligns with foundational approaches linking quantum entanglement and spacetime geometry — such as ER=EPR, Ryu–Takayanagi, and Jacobson’s thermodynamic gravity.  
However, unlike these geometric–entropic models, FRSR introduces a finite, entanglement-weighted energy formulation: curvature arises not from entropy or wormhole topology but from quantized vacuum energy coupling between −E and +E sectors.

## 8. Conclusion

The Finite Residual Rule of Sum (FRSR) presents a unified bridge between quantum entanglement, vacuum energy, and spacetime curvature.  
By interpreting the cosmological constant as the finite residual of a balanced but asymmetric entangled vacuum, FRSR provides a falsifiable framework that connects microscopic correlations to macroscopic geometry.  

Future work will focus on extending the model toward multi‑band simulations, investigating potential links with quantum field renormalization, and testing whether measurable curvature fluctuations ($`\delta\Lambda`$) can reveal the fingerprints of finite residual dynamics.
